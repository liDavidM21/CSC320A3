# This function implements the basic loop of the PatchMatch
# algorithm, as explained in Section 3.2 of the paper.
# The function takes an NNF f as input, performs propagation and random search,
# and returns an updated NNF.
#
# The function takes several input arguments:
#     - source_patches:      The matrix holding the patches of the source image,
#                            as computed by the make_patch_matrix() function. For an
#                            NxM source image and patches of width P, the matrix has
#                            dimensions NxMxCx(P^2) where C is the number of color channels
#                            and P^2 is the total number of pixels in the patch. The
#                            make_patch_matrix() is defined below and is called by the
#                            initialize_algorithm() method of the PatchMatch class. For
#                            your purposes, you may assume that source_patches[i,j,c,:]
#                            gives you the list of intensities for color channel c of
#                            all pixels in the patch centered at pixel [i,j]. Note that patches
#                            that go beyond the image border will contain NaN values for
#                            all patch pixels that fall outside the source image.
#     - target_patches:      The matrix holding the patches of the target image.
#     - f:                   The current nearest-neighbour field
#     - alpha, w:            Algorithm parameters, as explained in Section 3 and Eq.(1)
#     - propagation_enabled: If true, propagation should be performed.
#                            Use this flag for debugging purposes, to see how your
#                            algorithm performs with (or without) this step
#     - random_enabled:      If true, random search should be performed.
#                            Use this flag for debugging purposes, to see how your
#                            algorithm performs with (or without) this step.
#     - odd_iteration:       True if and only if this is an odd-numbered iteration.
#                            As explained in Section 3.2 of the paper, the algorithm
#                            behaves differently in odd and even iterations and this
#                            parameter controls this behavior.
#     - best_D:              And NxM matrix whose element [i,j] is the similarity score between
#                            patch [i,j] in the source and its best-matching patch in the
#                            target. Use this matrix to check if you have found a better
#                            match to [i,j] in the current PatchMatch iteration
#     - global_vars:         (optional) if you want your function to use any global variables,
#                            you can pass them to/from your function using this argument

# Return arguments:
#     - new_f:               The updated NNF
#     - best_D:              The updated similarity scores for the best-matching patches in the
#                            target
#     - global_vars:         (optional) if you want your function to use any global variables,
#                            return them in this argument and they will be stored in the
#                            PatchMatch data structure

# This function uses a computed NNF to reconstruct the source image

# and should return a reconstruction of the source image:
#     - rec_source: an openCV image that has the same shape as the source image
#
# To reconstruct the source, the function copies to pixel (x,y) of the source
# the color of pixel (x,y)+f(x,y) of the target.
#
# The goal of this routine is to demonstrate the quality of the computed NNF f.
# Specifically, if patch (x,y)+f(x,y) in the target image is indeed very similar
# to patch (x,y) in the source, then copying the color of target pixel (x,y)+f(x,y)
# to the source pixel (x,y) should not change the source image appreciably.
# If the NNF is not very high quality, however, the reconstruction of source image
# will not be very good.

# You should use matrix/vector operations to avoid looping over pixels,
